## Single responsibility principle
> A class should have one and only one reasons to change.


## Open closed principle
> Objects or entities should be 
- open for extension;
- but closed for modification

## Liskov substitution principle
> If something is true for the base class, it must be true for every derived class

## Interface segregation principle
> A client should never be forced to implement and interface that it doesn't use 

## Dependency Inversion principle
> Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations
